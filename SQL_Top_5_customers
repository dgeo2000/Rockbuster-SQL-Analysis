Code Goal: This SQL code calculates the average total amount paid by customers located in the top ten cities, which themselves are in the top ten countries by the number of customers.

Code Explanation:

-Defines a Common Table Expression (CTE) named average_amount_cte to streamline the query.
-Identifies the top ten countries by the number of customers using a subquery.
-Within these top countries, identifies the top ten cities by the number of customers using another subquery.
-Aggregates the total amount paid by customers residing in these top cities.
-Filters and limits the CTE results to the top five customers by total amount paid.
-Computes the average total amount paid by these top five customers from the CTE results.

Skills Used:
SQL querying, CTEs, subqueries, joins, aggregation functions, and data filtering
